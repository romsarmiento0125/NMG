Fernando María Félix Mateo Juan Nepomuceno de Norzagaray y Escudero was a Spanish soldier and colonial governor. Of Basque descent, he was a lieutenant general before becoming the 104th Governor of Puerto Rico and the 78th Governor of the Philippines under Spanish colonial rule.
The people of Barrio Casay worked for reforms politically, socially and economically, in order to be separated from Angat. They succeeded in their separation bid through Governor-General Fernándo Norzagaray y Escudero (1857-1860) who issued a Real Cedula declaring barrio Casay together with barrio Matictic to be constituted as a new independent town from Angat. Political boundaries of Angat and Pueblo de Casay y Matictic were demarcated and the newly created town was renamed as        "Norzagaray" in honor of the said Governor-General Fernando de Norzagaray.

It was also used as a sanctuary by the Japanese Imperial Army when the Philippines was liberated by joint Filipino and American Forces.
